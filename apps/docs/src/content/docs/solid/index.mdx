## Key Features

- **Reactive by Design**: Leverages SolidJS's fine-grained reactivity system
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Effect's powerful type system
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with Effect's error management
- **Performance**: Optimized for SolidJS's compilation and runtime performance
- **Composability**: Build complex applications from simple, composable parts
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and debugging support

## Why SolidJS + Effect?

SolidJS and Effect are a perfect match:

- **Fine-grained Reactivity**: SolidJS's reactive primitives work seamlessly with Effect's data flow
- **Compile-time Optimizations**: Both libraries optimize at compile time for maximum performance
- **Functional Programming**: Both embrace functional programming principles
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript support throughout the stack
- **Small Bundle Size**: Both libraries prioritize minimal runtime overhead

## Architecture Overview

```tsx
// Effect handles business logic and data flow
const fetchUser = (id: number) =>
  Effect.tryPromise({
    try: () => fetch(`/api/users/${id}`).then(res => res.json()),
    catch: (error) => new Error(`Failed to fetch user: ${error}`)
  })

// SolidJS handles reactive UI updates
function UserProfile(props: { userId: number }) {
  const [user] = createResource(
    () => props.userId,
    (id) => Effect.runPromise(fetchUser(id))
  )

  return (
    <Show when={user()} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <h1>{user()?.name}</h1>
    </Show>
  )
}
```
